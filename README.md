# csvoptimizer
Tool for comparing first row of csv file with another csv file and write a new file(works in automatic mode)

I've programmed this small .exe to create a file resulting after comparing two csv. files
Just download all files and start the .exe so you will be able to understand the work of this tool
Hauptdatei is Main Data Table
Vergleichsdatei is Table which you compare with

If you have any questions keiholzer@gmx.topmail.de
